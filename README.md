# Key insights

From the data reveal that attrition is highest among employees aged 25-34 followed by 35-44, especially in R&D and Sales departments, driven by career growth and performance pressures. Employees with Life Sciences and Medical backgrounds experience higher turnover due to market demand. In contrast, HR roles exhibit lower attrition, indicating better cultural alignment. Job dissatisfaction is notable in Sales Representatives, Sales Executives, and Laboratory Technicians, often linked to unmet expectations. Even satisfied Research Scientists show attrition, suggesting that external factors like career advancement or competitive offers influence turnover.

# Conclusion
This attrition analysis underscores the importance of implementing targeted retention strategies for specific demographics, job roles, and departments. By focusing on structured career development, promoting work-life balance, and enhancing job satisfaction, the organization can address the key drivers of attrition. These efforts will help create a more stable, engaged, and long-term workforce.
